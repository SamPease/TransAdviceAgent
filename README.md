# TransAdviceAgent

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered Q&A system that provides evidence-based information and advice on transgender topics, particularly focusing on medical and surgical information.

## Overview

TransAdviceAgent combines community knowledge from Reddit discussions, personal experiences, and medical resources to answer questions about transgender care. The system uses advanced AI to retrieve relevant information and provide comprehensive, source-backed responses.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Q&A**: Ask questions about transgender topics and get detailed, evidence-based answers
- **Source Attribution**: Every answer includes links to the original sources
- **Community Knowledge**: Leverages discussions from r/Transgender_Surgeries and other community resources
- **Medical Information**: Includes curated medical content about hormone therapy, surgical procedures, and care
- **Real-time API**: FastAPI backend for integration with web applications

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **AI/ML**: 
  - Anthropic Claude for natural language generation
  - HuggingFace transformers for text embeddings
  - LangGraph for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for semantic search
- **Document Storage**: SQLite for efficient document retrieval
- **Data Sources**: Reddit API, WhatsApp chat exports, curated text content

## Architecture

The system uses a sophisticated RAG pipeline that:

1. **Ingests** diverse data sources (Reddit posts, chat logs, medical texts)
2. **Processes** and chunks documents for optimal retrieval
3. **Embeds** content using sentence transformers
4. **Retrieves** relevant documents based on semantic similarity
5. **Summarizes** information using Claude AI
6. **Provides** comprehensive answers with source attribution

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Required for AI models
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Optional: For Reddit data collection
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_agent
   ```

3. **Build the vector store** (if you have data):
   ```bash
   python build_vectorstore.py
   ```

4. **Run the API server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Ask questions**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"question": "What should I know about hormone therapy?"}'
   ```

## Data Collection

The system can ingest data from multiple sources:

- **Reddit**: Use `get_reddit.py` to collect posts from r/Transgender_Surgeries
- **WhatsApp**: Use `copy_whatsapp_chats.py` to process chat exports
- **Text Files**: Add any `.txt` files to the `data/` directory
