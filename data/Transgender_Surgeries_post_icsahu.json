I know some folks have bad  dysphoria and want surgery asap, but really we only get one shot.   From what Iâ€™ve seen of her work, I wouldnâ€™t trust Dr. Rumer to give me a botox injection, let alone srs. \n\nWith some surgeons, they do not have a lot of training, but I think others just donâ€™t have any talent.   This leads to a lot of outcomes with significant complications that the doctors donâ€™t know how to repair.  Any surgery has the risk of poor or unwanted outcomes, but as the article points out we have no way of knowing which doctor is more likely to have complications and the extent and effectiveness of follow-up care.",

As I stated previously post Brassard in Montreal make us sign a a non picture disclosure form 30 minutes prior to surgery, then go on to perform a a low quality SRS technique based on speed and quantity and not quality and result. \n\nThe guy has 5 reviews on realself. Do your research and you will find multiple claim of people claiming they have been not been operated by him or Maude Belanger. I personally know for a fact Bensimon does SRS. Yes the FFS doctor there. \n\nInstead of supporting each other. The community rather lie to each other to make themselves feel better. \n\nMy SRS was done 1 hour 36 minute and it looks like crap. I will not and will never recommend people to go to Montreal. \n\nLow quality SRS. Huge monopoly since they got pretty much ( some exceptions) all the surgeries in Canada and itâ€™s covered in all provinces. ( big lobbying). \n\nI canâ€™t speak for Phalo and stuff but as far as vaginaâ€™s???? \n\nWorst place... final...\nWhoever says the contrary.\n\nProve it. I know Iâ€™m trying too.

He's very aggressive and will dismiss ANY complication you have,  even when they're usual ones, but belinky wil blame YOU for it. \n\nIt happens in every country. They're like a mafia. This needs to be talked more and more, we can't live being coerced and nothing is done to expose this business. I'm 6 weeks srs and my surgeon mistreated me in the worst ways (blaming on health, disobeying his guidelines, etc etc etc). I couldn't defend myself because they have such power and know we are vulnerable.  I'm facing complications and he blames to me for it, or doesn't answer my questions. Life It's a hell now and hope to recover well but I'm too weak to fight right now. I have recorded phonecalls with his aggressive words and accusations. \nThey know that blaming us for their bad praxis and unethic inhuman behavior is what works best. \n\nJust want to say that he maybe (not sure but possibly was him) sent to me a psychiatrist that to my surprise, was a gay guy...and they share lawyers and credibility. Exactly a mafia. The could make me go suicidal if they want, then blame my \"mental health x etc etc\"..\n\nThis needs to be exposed! I'm on tears for the girls and boys that have ruined lives after going to monsters of a surgeon!",

Now at 10 weeks, I am happy with the results, and slowly returning to my normally very physical life.\n\nWith the cost being comparable to the more popular Thai surgeons, IM Gender is well worth considering.\n\nJamieMarie",
