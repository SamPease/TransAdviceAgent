  "selftext": "I'm considering a revision of SRS with a sigmoid colon. At the beginning of the year, I had a growth of condylomas following an HPV infection. I had two vaginal excision and laser operations. This significantly reduced the length and width. A complete cessation of dilations and intercourse was necessary for 7 months. Despite a resumption of dilations, it remains shortened, and I cannot have intercourse with my partner.\nWho has already had a revision in the sigmoid colon? How much pain is it? How often do dilations occur? Are there any drawbacks with the sigmoid colon?",
