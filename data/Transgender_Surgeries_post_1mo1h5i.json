  "selftext": "Today at work my coworker noticed my hairline scar from FFS. He asked how I got it, and I awkwardly joked that it was from brain surgery. He asked if it was cancer or a skateboarding accident, and I realized I have no “go-to” story for curious people, and maybe I need one. What do you all tell people about your hairline scar if they see it? Do you go with something funny, honest, or make up an epic tale? Would love to hear some suggestions ",
