  "selftext": "So I am 1 year post op now. Really happy with the result in regards to feeling and depth. Kinda in the middle with how it looks, i have been told it looks like a cis vagina by my GP (huisdokter) but i dunno, it feels weird.\n\nSexual stuff in the spoilerd part.\n\n>!I have been able to get orgasms through penetration an clitoral stimulation so I am really happy with that. Getting to an orgasm takes slightly longer than before and sometimes does not happen (am also on meds that can induce anorgasmia) but it still feels really good.!<\n\nOver all i am happy with the result and am really glad i got this done. I dillate about once every 2 days and sometimes once every 3 days.",
