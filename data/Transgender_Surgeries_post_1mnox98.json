  "selftext": "So hey! This is me from the other day, maybe you saw my post the other day, maybe not. \n\nSo, my mom asked me if I wanted to keep my OG genitalia and if that‚Äôs why I was so nervous, that really stung. Eventually my dad came to visit and I talked about it with him, I had little time to make a choice so I said\n\nYes\n\nI feel weird now, how do you even know if you made the right choice? \n\nYou may call me stupid and I probably am but, there‚Äôs this friend who has always been great to me, even now in this crisis. She liked me, back in uni but I didn‚Äôt notice at first, then I played dumb cos I got scared. Throughout the years I think I have developed feelings for her and suddenly, some ideas have come to my mind.\n\n1) this isn‚Äôt about her, I will never tell her but about what my feelings reveal: I don‚Äôt see myself using my OG genitalia often but, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad, under the right circumstances\n\n2) What if I was scared of using it because I was scared of ‚Äúbeing a man‚Äù by what society taught me, and not necessarily disliked it? I don‚Äôt see myself using it a lot but I wonder, if it couldn‚Äôt have been too bad? \n\n3) Fear of closing the door on an unique way of being, like this, despite of the suffering it had brought me, perhaps I was seeing it wrong? And I know I shouldn‚Äôt make decisions based on x or y hypothetical people liking me in the future but, the death of the possibilities worries me. The death of so many WHAT IFs\n\n4) If I don‚Äôt do the surgery now I feel like I‚Äôm not advancing at all, we been waiting for this for half a year already, I would feel stuck. And I‚Äôm already 23 next week, I would like to live some of my 20s the way I wanna live, if that‚Äôs with a vagina. This was a BIG part of why I made my decision, as to not waste time \n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm sorry for my rambling. If anyone has had such worries before I would appreciate any input, the choice is made, maybe if I hurry I could change it but probably not, this is probably my first and last update \n\nThank you üíú\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "This is *your* transition, based *entirely* on *your* needs, desires, safety, and comfort levels. It‚Äôs *normal* to have concerns and questions before life-changing surgery like this. As a parent, I know your parents are concerned, but they can‚Äôt understand the dysphoria you feel. Cis people simply have no reference points to understand what it means to be transgender. I hope that you have a good therapist, preferably someone with experience in gender and LGBTQ issues, a professional neutral party who can help you figure out just what you want and need. This is the time to talk with them.\n\nThis surgery is a leap of faith. You‚Äôre very young, so you may not have had any decisions to make like this before. There are many points in life where you just can‚Äôt know how something is going to turn out. You go into these situations with the hope that they will turn out well, that they will bring you the peace and happiness you desire and deserve, but you can‚Äôt know beforehand. This is *your* choice. It‚Äôs not your father‚Äôs choice, it‚Äôs not your mother‚Äôs choice, it‚Äôs not some possible friend from uni‚Äôs choice, and it‚Äôs certainly not some nebulous concept of society‚Äôs choice. This is *entirely* about what *you* think is best for *you*. You‚Äôre an adult, and part of being an adult is listening to yourself and no one else, to make the choice that‚Äôs right for *you*.\n\nI can‚Äôt tell you what the right choice is for you. \n\nI can tell you that I had many of the same questions as you, at 66 years old. This was major surgery with higher risks because of my age and medical issues. I had my GCS in December. As I was recovering, I had the simple, powerful, profound revelation that I *KNOW* I‚Äôm *finally* in the *right* body. My dysphoria is GONE. \n\nI can‚Äôt tell you that you‚Äôll have the same revelation.\n\nYou‚Äôre young, hopefully with a long, joyful life ahead of you. You already have a pretty good idea of who and what you are. You have the opportunity waiting for you to have this life-changing surgery, but you also have time to reflect and figure out what‚Äôs best for you. \n\nIt is all too easy to let our fears and anxieties grow all out of proportion to the eventual result, especially in cases like this. Far too often, the things we regret in life are the choices where we didn‚Äôt take that leap of faith, when we played it safe, or let others tell us what they thought best for us even as we thought differently.\n\nThis is *entirely* your call. No one can possibly know what will happen, regardless of *your* decision. Only *you* can know what‚Äôs right for *you*. Given that, without any other opinions, what‚Äôs *your* heart and mind telling *you?* ü´Çüë≠üíú\n\n67, 3+ years in transition, fully out almost the entire time, now rocking my Christmas vagina!, living an amazing life as the incredible woman I was *always* meant to be! üéâüéäüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®üíúüî•",

I had surgery at 27 and still have a whole life with a vagina ahead of me. So will you! No matter if you do it now or in ten years.\n\nMaybe try and use your current genitalia. See how it makes you feel when you‚Äôre with someone you like.\n\nThe only reason to get the surgery, in my opinion, is if you need the surgery to continue with your life (and all that‚Äôs part of that: like romance, etc)",

Only concern would possible be paying a fee for services not rendered but it sounds unethical in this situation",

      "body": "I think you should try and reframe your questions. Instead of asking \"what if I regret this\" ask \"what if everything goes well\". \n\nWhat I'm saying is none of these questions sound like \"I actually want/am fine with my penis\". Moreso, they sound like bargaining. Trying to convince yourself it's not that bad because you don't feel you deserve a vagina. \n\nI'm saying this because of what you said in your first post. That you feel like having a vagina would add pressure of having to fit a spesific idea of being a woman that you don't feel you have earned. That it would essentially remove the shield of being a \"work in progress\" woman so to speak. \n\nSo that is why I'm proposing the reframing. Suppose everything goes well, without any complications or issues and you have a functioning and normal looking vagina. Would you internally be happy with that? And externally? \n\nAnd if not what exactly would the issues you feel you would have be? \n\nWhat exactly are you worried about?",

      "body": "Nerves, fear, self-doubt, all seem to be common before surgery.  Myself, as well as quite a few other post op trans women have all had similar fears‚Ä¶. Surgery is a BIG thing! I recommend talking to your counselor in depth, and listening to your self, deep down inside as to what you truly want. You can cancel very close to the surgery if I am not mistaken, give it a few more weeks. As you get closer, you may find more clarity and confidence. That‚Äôs just my two cents worth, I was terrified and had a bunch of self doubt a few weeks out, but I soul searched a bit more and talked to my counselor and people close to me and a week before it all changed, I was excited and became more so right up until the morning of, then I was terrified a bit again but because‚Ä¶ major surgery. When I woke up a few hours later, I‚Äôve never felt more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and happier in my life. I am 8+ weeks post op, finally getting back to my life and feeling amazing. For me the doubt was kind of a ‚Äúpanic dysphoria‚Äù and a bit of imposter syndrome feelings, all justified from the echos of a voice in my own mind that kept me imprisoned most of my life. I‚Äôm 51, it‚Äôs never too late, but I also regret all the precious time I‚Äôve missed not truly living, so I thought I‚Äôd share. Either way, in the end, always let it be YOUR choice.",

One of the lead surgeons was out sick (I had PPT and there were two surgical teams) and it was rescheduled for a month later. It hit me soo hard that I just broke down sobbing on the phone, couldn't even finish the conversation and hung up. This completely solidified my determination to get this surgery. \n\nSo to OP I'll just say, imagine you get this call. How would it make you feel?",
