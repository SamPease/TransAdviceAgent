I guess Airbnb after those 5 or 6 days in hospital and stockpile A LOT of water, food (specifically purrées), clean clothes... Anything else that's crucial to know for survival? Physical survival or mental one...\\\nI'm a fucking heroine, so that's not the first time I'm alone but I'm also aware that the GRS recovery (especially hybrid PPT) is extremely difficult...",

      "body": "I did it alone in Thailand, it went perfectly, but do I recommend it? Fuck no, they had everything set, and I had daily nurse visits, and twice a week examination with suregon. I really had the perfect conditions, and it was STILL difficult, i also had no pain, or major complicatons, apart from granulation.\n\n  \nI recommend getting a grabber because bending is a no, no. Honestly, i cant imagine doing this alone, once home, I had EVERYTHING taken cared of. My mom & my sister clean, and cook and do everything for me, and i still find the recovery incredibly difficult. Few weeks away from 3 months, and i STILL cant sit, lift heavy things, wear my skin tight Levi's, or drive my car. Going back to work is out of the question!\n\n  \nReading what you wrote is incredibly worrying, because it seems you are underestimating how serious this surgery is. I applaud anyone doing this on their own, but it is nearly impossible in the long run, and can have major bad consequences, which can set you back for several months, and make revision almost certain.\n\n  \nPlease think it through, I did over a decade of research before I did this, I went to Suporn Clinic, and they are known for a brutal recovery, but it seems your method might be even more difficult?!?",

Like I’m not positive you should even go through with it if you don’t have any caregivers at all.\n\nIt’s crucial to limit your activity as much as possible, and absolutely no stairs bending or lifting, or even really sitting upright. \n\n\nIdk that you need purées? Pretty sure most folks do a normal diet.\n\nIf you’re dead set on continuing anyway, just think anything you can do to eliminate steps in your activities of daily living. Pre-prepared things that can be done in a microwave, you’re not going to be able to cook. Get bath wipes to get around standing up to shower for the first bit. Arrange things in your recovery space to be as close together as possible to limit walking as much as possible.",

I had a few cases of nearly fainting after leaving the hospital that would have been bad without someone at hand. The first week I definitely wanted someone around the clock but, for the most part, they didn't have a lot to do.\n\nBy the end of the second week though, I was pretty independent. I could drive and take care of enough of the house stuff that it wasn't a big deal. I was off the opiates and doing just NSAIDs for pain. Support at that point was essentially just emotional and being kept company rather than actually needing things done for me. Maybe some gentle nudging to go do dilations and picking stuff up that I'd dropped.\n\nI also helped my girlfriend through her second week of recovery. It was pretty similar for her. She was up and walking but was pretty low energy and needed some encouragement to do self care. There was some amount of nursing involved there to help trim some errant stitches and such but nothing too involved. I helped with showering and such but that was mostly because we were comfortable with each other.",

If you can squat ass to floor with your knees together and get back up without risking falling you can pick up (light) objects from the floor with minimal risk of wound separation etc.\n\n\nI was back to work for an admin job WFH at 5 weeks and in office for 4 days a week at 8 weeks, so if you have this kind of work it could be doable.\n\n\nI think my recovery was pretty close to a best case scenario and I did have support available if it wasn't manageable on my own. I'd recommend having at least a contingency plan if you need extra help if at all possible.",

It took a lot out of her and it could be emotionally and physically exhausting, but she did it.\n\nSo it is possible.   But if you choose this path and don’t have someone with you, even part of the time, OP, you need to make sure you are mentally prepared and have a network of friends and support you can chat with via text or FaceTime.  It is an enormous mental effort (even having someone there, like I did).\n\nIt sounds like you have a couple years to prepare OP?  In that case I recommend some study and practice in dance (body control and strength), breathing exercises, and meditation.  Those three skills can help immensely.",
