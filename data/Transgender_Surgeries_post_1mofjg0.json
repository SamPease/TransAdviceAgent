  "selftext": "Hey ladies! It seems like FFS Coverage in this state a grey area from my experience, I’m in SD county and have SHARP (HMO) and got denied for FFS back in 2022. For a while I convinced myself I don’t need it but my dysphoria has gotten a lot worse and it’s something I’m looking into again. I have heard certain parts of the state seem to have regional policies or standardisation for if it’s covered or not while others it’s really random. I’ve heard FFS will be covered in the Bay Area, and heard of people getting it covered in Los Angeles. I am curious to know the experiences of the California dolls in here who’ve had success in this area. I would honestly consider a move atp just so I can have this done",
