I need an unbiased opinion because i feel like it looks too upturned (lowkey resembling those ski slope noses) :/ especially considering the photos i showed were more natural looking and less upward slanted. i also feel like it doesn‚Äôt fit my face for this reason. am i right to think this? and does it look natural? please be honest, everyone around me says it‚Äôs fine but i really don‚Äôt think it is ",

      "body": "You have a straight bridge with a (only somewhat) raised tip. You do not have a scooped out / dipped bridge. One of the requirements of the \"ski-slope nose\" is a dipped bridge.\n\nI noticed in your photos that your posture changes slightly and each time it sort of has an effect on how the tip is seen. In some photos it appears more raised then others; however, this is in direct relationship to how raised your chin is in the photo. When your chin is most neutral your nose tip looks more neutral.\n\nMy conclusion is that you're overthinking this and NO (actually HELL NO) your tip is NOT too upturned.\n\nFinal points:\n\n- Rhinoplasty is among the most complex surgeries to make precision alterations. Revisions are exponentially more difficult and even fewer surgeons are great at them... Sometimes you need to know when to leave well enough alone. I think this is one of those times. Your nose looks great, it's in balance with your face, and you look beautiful. This is a great and extremely enviable aesthetic outcome and you might benefit from reflecting on that and focusing on enjoying the gift of beauty (and access). If what was shared above is somehow not enough, it's possible you're experiencing dysmorphia (different from dysphoria) which isnt suited to treatment with more surgery and would be best approached through therapy.\n\n- Be mindful of how you let what others say affect you. Regardless of how it's intended, feedback on our looks can be difficult to receive. Some people make rude off hand remarks, completely uninformed, and without consideration of its objectiveness or compassion. My personal opinion is that this is what your mother did. Only u will know what is in her heart and intent... It's possible, maybe even likely, she just had a human moment of adjusting to the new face of her child and said something out loud that was both inaccurate and hurtful without thinking it through or intending it. If u think that's the case, let it slide. It can take time for our loved ones to adjust just like it can take time to personally adjust to changes in appearance after surgery.\n\nBe gentle with yourself and wishing you the best.",

They tend to upturn the nose a bit too much, and recommend a ski slope. Ski slope noses don‚Äôt fit everyone even if it‚Äôs ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù, especially if you aren‚Äôt white or have a baby face.",
